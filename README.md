# Password-generation-using-python

n today's digital world, security is of utmost importance. One of the most fundamental aspects of securing online accounts and sensitive data is using strong, unique passwords. This project aims to create a simple yet effective password generator using the Python programming language. The password generator will produce random, complex passwords to enhance security and protect against potential cyber threats. By leveraging Python's built-in libraries and functions, we will develop a tool that can generate passwords of various lengths and complexities, ensuring robust protection for users' accounts and information.
